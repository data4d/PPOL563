    "Most students are accustomed to working with flat files (csv, excel, etc) as their primary data stores. There is good reason for this; these file are small, easy to share, and easy to work with. However, in industry its generally considered bad practice to use flat files as your primary data repository. Instead, you may need to work with a variety of different databases both locally and in the cloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get in the practice of making requests to databases it's good practice to read from a SQLite database (stored locally). This semester I will be using the World Bank's World Development Indicator Database for a variety of different demonstrations. You can download a copy of the database here: https://www.kaggle.com/worldbank/world-development-indicators#database.sqlite\n",
